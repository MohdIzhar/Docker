# build the dockerfile 

docker build -t centos/cmd:v1 .

# now create the docker contianer by running the following cmd and observer the output

docker run -it --name cmd_c1 centos/cmd:v1

# check the docker container are up or down

docker ps

# now start the container again

docker start cmd_c1

# again check the containers are up or down

docker ps 

you will see the container start and gives the output and then exited
So, the CMD is run when the container is instantiated to display some output
