# Download jdk in current folder

# build the dockerfile

docker build -t centos/jdk8:v1 .

This file contain the env variable to setup using export command

# create docker container to check the env

docker run -it --name jdk_env centos/jdk8:v1 /bin/bash

env	# you will see the setup path of JAVA_HOME

cat ~/.bashrc	# also see the path added


# Now adding the JAVA_BIN path using ENV instruction

I have renamed the previous docker file as Dockerfile.export and in new Dockerfile added the ENV instruction

docker build -t centos/jdk8:v1 .

# create container

docker run -it --name env_jdk centos/jdk8:v1 /bin/bash

within contianer run env, you will see the path has been added
